Not yet done:

-improve playback position indicator
 -inverted triangle shape
 -set up looping region (start-end)
-do better with lengthy samples (as in the length of a song)
 -store all the frame data in a buffered image in the first place? --this is probably easiest
 -OR only render the visible portion into a buffered image? (perhaps by implementing a special viewport)
 -OR keep sample data in the (wlog, WAV file) it came from and only convert it based on the clip's current
     viewport. on playback, we'd have to sync all the changes back to the time domain and transition
     to and from what's stored on disk. Hmm. This might be related to "Do modifications as a stack of
     layers rather than modifying the data directly." And it would also help with arbitrary zoom, both
     horizontal and vertical, since we'd always be starting from time domain. Hmm.
-be able to import mp3, aac, and ogg vorbis
-be able to zoom in an arbitrary amount, both horizontally and vertically (this will involve redoing the
 DCT with different frame sizes and overlaps)
-better user interface for choosing a tool and changing its properties
 -paint tool brush shape (based on greyscale bitmaps)
 -copy/paste with option of logarithmic or linear
-(internal) refactor the region tools once there are enough of them to know what's common and what's special
-(internal) API fix: it should be a secret that the clip data is painted upside down.
 practical upshot: remove the ClipPanel.toClipCoords() method, and everything
                   should still work the same.
 easiest fix: just reverse the DCT results after computing, and re-reverse them
              before performing the inverse xform.
 best fix: figure out how to compute the DCT that way in the first place
 compromise: hide the array in Frame, and have the access methods translate the
             y value.
-a "find harmonics" tool that would search for overtones by shape similarity
-file menu with open and close; multiple projects open at same time
-edit menu with image and audio copy and paste
-ability to play just the selected (time) region; optional looping
-top-level exception catcher (including uncaught swing exceptions)
-Do modifications as a stack of layers rather than modifying the data directly
-import and export 16-bit greyscale images


Release 0.4:
-Improved colourization so it has more user control, and can optionally use an additional
 colour (red) to double the displayed value resolution (now 16 bits instead of 8 bits).
-Made view settings sliders exponential instead of linear. This greatly improves the
 useful range, which used to be squished to the bottom
-(internal) new JSlider subclass that makes it easy to create a slider with a configurable
 curve and known min and max values
-fixed play/pause button so it reverts to "Play" again when playback is finished
-the undo and redo buttons now become disabled when there is nothing to undo or redo (respectively)
-Pause and rewind are now immediate (they don't wait for the output buffer to drain) 
-position readout now shows nearest musical note (to the semitone)
-a simple JVM memory monitor is now at the bottom of the window
-made a better threshold tool icon (less ridiculous, but still not amazing)
-simplistic playback indicator proof-of-concept (needs improvement)
-click in clip heading to reposition playback
-ensure playback continues until end of clip (it seems to not be draining the buffer)

Release 0.3: August 28, 2008
-Undo/redo for modifications (painting and regions)
-(internal) Moved region features into ClipPanel so it's easier to make new region tools
-now the window is never wider than the screen when opening a new clip
-bigger scroll increment on clip panel
-moved save button, undo/redo, and shuttle controls to top (into toolbar)
-(internal) clip panel now fires property change events when region changes
-"scale region" tool now uses a slider instead of two buttons
-(internal)undo logic in scale region tool now works when undoing while an edit is in progress
 -this was done by implementing replaceEdit() and firing a new undoable edit for every step of the slider
-(internal) clip panel now fires undo events when region changes
-Improved user interface for choosing tools and interacting with them
-Implemented new tools that operate on a selected rectangular region:
  -zero out data over/under a threshold
  -scale data up or down
  -flip data upside down or backwards
-(internal) fixed off-by-1 error in flip
-Continuous readout reporting mouse position: frequency (y axis) and time (x axis). 
-huge performance improvement in clip->display updates (the brightness slider is now "like butter")
-(internal) factored out an interface so it's easy to come up with different colorization strategies


Release 0.2: August 9, 2008
Fixes to save dialog:
 -now it works (failed with ClassCastException in 0.1)
 -appends ".wav" to filenames that don't already end with ".wav"


Release 0.1: August 7, 2008
-forward transform (analysis)
-Reverse transform
 -in-program playback
 -save modified audio back to WAV file
-pref for fft-data to image-data multiplier (i.e. brightness)
-Paintbrush tool for modifying spectral data
-selective image update (to make paintbrush more responsive)
-build script that creates a single executable jar with release number in its name
-don't stretch the image when it's smaller than the dialog (paint blank space instead)
-show product version number in UI

        Perhaps the classic overview paper for discrete-time windows. It discusses some 15 different classes of windows including their spectral responses and the reasons for their development. [Brian Evans, bevans@ece.utexas.edu]

        An elegant method for designing a time-discrete solution for realization of a spectral window which is ideal from an energy concentration viewpoint. This window is one that concentrates the maximum amount of energy in a specified bandwidth and hence provides optimal spectral resolution. Unlike the Kaiser window, this window is a discrete-time realization having the same objectives as the continuous-time prolate spheroidal function; at the expense of not having a closed form solution.

    D. J. Thomson, "Spectrum Estimation and Harmonic Analysis," Proc. of the IEEE, vol. 70, no. 9, pp. 1055-1096, Sep. 1982.

        In his classic 1982 paper, David Thompson proposes the powerful multiple-window method, which is an elegant and robust technique for spectrum estimation. Based on the Cramer representation, Thompson's method is nonparametric, consistent, efficient, and optimally suited for finite data samples. In addition, it has excellent bias control and stability, provides an analysis of variance test for line components, and finally, works very well in many practical applications. Unfortunately, his important work has been neglected in many textbooks and graduate courses on statistical signal processing.
